# Netflix Clone

# Introduction

Hello! The is a Clone of Netflix! It reacts and feels like the real Netflix! This app uses TMDB's very powerful API to pull and populate each of the rows with movies and Tv Shows. Since the banner of the 'Featured Show/Movie' changes everytime the banner info is hard to read at times. Netflix specifically creates the images for their banner with this in mind, and keeps the images dark to keep the contrast up.
